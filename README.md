# [Error Boundaries](#)

> [see reactjs docs](reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)

## Overview

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in
their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead
of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during
rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below
them.
